Example for CRUD, works for both hibernate and jpa if you use the queries in "Database Initialization.txt"
    Research: GET /{version}/employee/0
    Insert: POST /{version}/employee
        request body = {
                            "name": "Test Employee",
                            "age": 54,
                            "salary": 101,
                            "dept_id": 0
                       }
    Update PUT /{version}/employee
        request body = {
                            "id": {the number return by insert api}
                            "name": "Test Employee2",
                            "age": 55,
                            "salary": 1000,
                            "dept_id": 0
                       }
    Delete DELETE /{version}/employee/{the number return by insert api}
